/* 
? what is an algorithm?
> in the most general sense an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

? characteristics of an algorithm
> it should have defined inputs and outputs
> it should be language independent, it should be written in such a way that it can be used with different programming languages

? why should you learn about algorithms?
> it basically helps learning different techniques to efficiently solve different problems.
> it is important to keep in mind that one problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms and every algorithm comes with its own trade-offs when it comes to performance.
